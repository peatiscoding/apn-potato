```bash
./push --help
```

‡πçYou can check your configuration by running: 

```bash
./push validate
```

For pushing to specific device:

```bash
./push device <your_device_id>
```

## Advance usage

By default it will push to Staging APN server (produciton = false) override that with

```bash
./push device <your_device_id> --prod true
```

Or if you wish to push the device to non `voip` topic. use `--voip false` to push the notification to normal topic.

```bash
./push device <your_device_id> --voip false
```

You may also customise the notification in `push` script as well. By supplying message which will select the message of push content in the function defined within.
